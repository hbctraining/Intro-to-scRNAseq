### Description

This **Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq analysis** workshop will instruct participants on how to design and analyze a single-cell RNA-seq experiment from start to end.  

This will be a hands-on workshop geared towards biologists in which we will focus on using the Seurat package using R/RStudio. Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the [Introduction to R workshop](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/). The lessons are spread over 3 sessions, totaling around 7.5 hours of trainer-led time.


### Learning Objectives

- Explain common considerations when designing a single-cell RNA-seq experiment
- Discuss the steps involved in taking raw single-cell RNA-sequencing data and generating a count (gene expression) matrix
- Compute and assess QC metrics at every step in the workflow
- Cluster cells based on expression data and derive the identity of the different cell types present
- Perform integration of different sample conditions
- Annotate cells with marker genes

**Be sure to follow the Installation steps in the pre-reading**
